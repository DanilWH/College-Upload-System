#### What a session is

HTTP is a stateless protocol, so it doesn't save the fact that you are already logged in.
At each request, HTTP doesn’t know anything about what happened before, it just carries the request.
So for any request for private data you would have to log in again to make sure the application knows
this is really you. That’s how sessions are very useful.

That’s the problem that sessions solve.

If you've gotten into a session reset problem, here is useful information on how to fix that.
